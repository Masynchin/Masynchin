I am a little pogrommer from Cherepovets, studying at SPbU.

I mostly write in Python, but also interested in PureScript, TypeScript, and Go.

Here is the list of some of my projects:

- :partly_sunny: [CheWeatherBot](https://github.com/Masynchin/CheWeatherBot) -
  Telegram-bot about weather in my hometown.
- :clipboard: [Ndnt](https://github.com/Masynchin/ndnt) -
  CLI-tool to inspect indentation of your files.
- :speech_balloon: [Textode](https://github.com/Masynchin/textode) -
  Library which makes creating stateless-dialog systems easy.

I am currently working at:

- :game_die: [Three](https://github.com/Masynchin/Three) - 3D version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
- :memo: [Change-a-Changelog](https://github.com/Masynchin/change-a-changelog) - CLI-tool for editing a changelog.
