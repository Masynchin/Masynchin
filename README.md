I am a little pogrommer from Cherepovets.

I mostly write in Python, but also interested in PureScript, TypeScript, and Go.

Here is the list of some of my projects:

- [CheWeatherBot](https://github.com/Masynchin/CheWeatherBot) -
  Telegram-bot about weather in my hometown.
- [ndnt](https://github.com/Masynchin/ndnt) -
  CLI-tool to inspect indentation of your project files.
- [textode](https://github.com/Masynchin/textode) -
  Library which makes creating stateless-dialog systems more easy.
- [logos](https://github.com/Masynchin/logos) -
  Create SVG icons interactively.
