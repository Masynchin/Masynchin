# Â¡Yahoo! :partying_face:

I am a little pogrommer from Cherepovets.

I mostly write in Python, but also interested in PureScript, TypeScript, and Go.

Here is the list of some of my projects:

- :partly_sunny: [CheWeatherBot](https://github.com/Masynchin/CheWeatherBot) -
  Telegram-bot about weather in my hometown.
- :clipboard: [Ndnt](https://github.com/Masynchin/ndnt) -
  CLI-tool to inspect indentation of your files.
- :speech_balloon: [Textode](https://github.com/Masynchin/textode) -
  Library which makes creating stateless-dialog systems easy.

You can read history of all my repositories
